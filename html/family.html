                        I come from a loving family of five, and as the eldest, I am grateful for the support and encouragement from my parents, Ainur and Seitzhan. My mother, Ainur, is a dedicated professional who always inspires me with her hard work and determination. My father, Altai, is my role model; he teaches me the value of perseverance and integrity in everything I do.
                        <br>I have two younger siblings who add joy and excitement to our household. My little brother, Mukhammed-Alim, is in 6th grade, and he loves exploring new things and sharing his adventures with me. He has a curious mind and always asks the most interesting questions. My little sister, Khadisha, in 5th grade, brings her own sparkle to our family. Her creativity and enthusiasm for life remind us all to cherish the little moments.
